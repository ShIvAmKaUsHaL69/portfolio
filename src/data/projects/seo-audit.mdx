# SEO Audit Automation

## Overview

An end-to-end automated SEO audit system built with n8n. Submit a website URL through a simple form, and two custom AI agents (Technical & Content Audit) run an AI-powered analysis via GPT. A detailed, formatted report is emailed directly to you.

## How It Works

1. **Form Submission** — Submit a website URL through a simple form
2. **Web Scraping** — The site is automatically scraped for content and technical data
3. **Dual AI Agent Analysis** — Technical Audit Agent + Content Audit Agent analyze the data
4. **Report Generation** — Suggestions for SEO & content improvement are compiled
5. **Email Delivery** — A detailed, formatted report is emailed directly to you

## Features

- **Fully Automated** — Zero manual effort from submission to report delivery
- **Dual AI Agents** — Specialized technical and content analysis
- **GPT-Powered** — Leverages OpenAI for intelligent analysis
- **Email Reports** — Formatted reports delivered via Gmail integration
