# Self-Host WhatsApp for Your Business — Zero Cost

Most WhatsApp Business API solutions charge per message. What if I told you there's a way to connect WhatsApp directly to your business with **no third-party services**, **no per-message fees**, and **full control over your data**?

Meet **WAHA** (WhatsApp HTTP API) — a self-hosted, open-source solution that pairs beautifully with **n8n** for workflow automation.

## Why Self-Host?

| Feature | Third-Party APIs | WAHA (Self-Hosted) |
|---------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Cost | $0.05-0.15 per message | Free |
| Data Control | Their servers | Your servers |
| Customization | Limited | Unlimited |
| Vendor Lock-in | Yes | No |
| Setup Time | Minutes | ~1 hour |

## Architecture Overview

Here's how the pieces fit together:

```
WhatsApp ←→ WAHA (Docker) ←→ n8n (Automation) ←→ Your Business Logic
```

1. **WAHA** handles the WhatsApp connection and exposes an HTTP API
2. **n8n** listens for incoming messages and triggers automated workflows
3. **Your logic** processes the data and sends responses back through WAHA

## Step 1: Deploy WAHA with Docker

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name waha \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  -e WHATSAPP_DEFAULT_ENGINE=WEBJS \
  devlikeapro/waha
```

That's it. WAHA is now running on port 3000. Open `http://localhost:3000` to scan the QR code with your WhatsApp.

## Step 2: Set Up n8n

If you don't have n8n running yet:

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name n8n \
  -p 5678:5678 \
  -v n8n_data:/home/node/.n8n \
  n8nio/n8n
```

Open `http://localhost:5678` and you're in the n8n editor.

## Step 3: Create a Webhook Trigger

In WAHA, configure a webhook to send incoming messages to n8n:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/webhooks \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "url": "http://your-server:5678/webhook/whatsapp",
    "events": ["message"]
  }'
```

In n8n, create a new workflow with a **Webhook** node as the trigger. Set the path to `/whatsapp`.

## Step 4: Build Your Automation

Here's where it gets powerful. Some real workflows I've built:

### Auto-Reply Bot

```
Webhook → IF (contains "hello") → Send Reply "Hi! How can I help you?"
```

### Order Confirmation

```
Webhook → Extract Order ID → Query Database → Format Message → Send WhatsApp Reply
```

### Lead Capture

```
Webhook → Extract Name + Phone → Add to Google Sheets → Send Welcome Message
```

### AI-Powered Conversations

```
Webhook → Extract Message → Send to LLM API → Send AI Response via WhatsApp
```

## Step 5: Send Messages via API

Sending a message through WAHA is a simple HTTP call:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/sendText \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "chatId": "919929371862@c.us",
    "text": "Hello from my self-hosted WhatsApp bot!"
  }'
```

In n8n, use an **HTTP Request** node to call this endpoint.

## Real-World Use Case: Restaurant Customer Retention

I built a system for restaurants where:

1. Customer places an order
2. System generates a **personalized image** with order details
3. WhatsApp message is sent with the image and a "visit again" reminder
4. All automated, all self-hosted, **zero recurring costs**

## Security Considerations

- Run WAHA behind a reverse proxy (Nginx) with HTTPS
- Use authentication tokens for the WAHA API
- Keep Docker images updated
- Don't expose ports directly to the internet

## Conclusion

Self-hosting WhatsApp for business is not just possible — it's practical. With WAHA and n8n, you get:

- **Zero message costs**
- **Full data ownership**
- **Unlimited customization**
- **Powerful automation workflows**

The initial setup takes about an hour, and after that, you have a production-ready WhatsApp integration that scales with your business.
